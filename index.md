# Sensory Processes

## Reception
* Sensory receptors


## Transduction
* change the stimulus energy into an electrochemical neural change, which means letting the brain understand the information

## Coding
* Sensory goes to appropriate location and got processed

# Vision
? what is stimulus? `light`
!! Human cannot see ultraviolet
!! bees can see ultraviolet but not red

# Anotomy of the Eye
? How to determine if an eye is right or left? See `Optic nerve`, it shoulld lean towards the middle of the head

* Cornea: transparent thing that protect your eye
* Iris: create a space where light goes through. The function is to control the volume of light coming into your eye
* Lens: have muscle around it to loose it or strenthen it. This help focus on the object you are looking at
* Retina: the receptor of light

# The visual field
* Optic Disk: blind spot
* Fovea: direct line of communication to the brain. When you see someone, you put them into the fovea, other things are blurred
* periphery: The nose and cheek side of the eyeball. Better sensitivity to dim light, but not detailed information
* Transduction: take place in Retina. Retina r

**if optic nerve is damaged(claucoma), you go blind because you are not able to receive informaton to your brain**

# Two kinds of photoreceptors
* Rods(120 million): on peripheral
* Cones(6 million): on the fovea

## Macular degeneration: Fovea and small surrounding area are destroyed

## Retinitis pigmentosa: Rods are destroed first

## what happen in photoreceptors
* Photopigment--->Reception & Transduction
**The neurotransmitter released by the photoreceptor inhibits the bipolar cell

# Color coding 
## trichromatic coding(RGB)
* Blue(430 wavelength)
  Green(540 wavelength)
  Red(560 wavelength)
